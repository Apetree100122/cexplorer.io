# Banlist

We have a built-in universal banlist, so even if the blockchain is open, we can at least help a bit to prevent potential damages.

Because many projects use our API, we distribute our list much deeper into the community.

## Snapshots

### Can I add some fake-asset into your banlist?

We always appreciate your help! Send to our email please all required info - like your (origin) asset name, asset ID, policy ID, proof that you are the legal owner and then copycat info - asset name, asset ID, policy ID, etc. We always appreciate more information rather than less. 

### How can I find some fake-assets or copycats?

We have developed a tool specifically for this purpose - log into cexplorer.io and go to "Content console" > "Copycats" and you can search.

#### Disclaimer

Blockchain is permissionless. 
Basicly, you cannot ban or delete some record from blockchain. The only thing that can be done is to demand censorship on the part of the services that display this data.
The information on this site may contain errors or mistakes, please do your own research.
There is zero responsibility if you will use our snapshots.
