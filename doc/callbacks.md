# Callbacks ## Pool-related notifications You can set up this feature in SPO console > Manage pool > tab "Config". Note: If you want to deactivate this feature, update your callback url to empty and submit. Notification structure what your script will receive (POST RAW body - json-encoded array) : 
```

{  "pool" : "pool1..........",
  "type" : "type",
  "message" : "human friendly message",
  "url" : "for block ie we send https://cexplorer.io/block/blockId"}
  
```
### Available types: test - for internal purposes only; you should ignore this type; but, we can send callback with this type to verify if is your url valid and working (as Compatibility) - if returns "ok" output :-) - epoch - pool results after epoch transition- delegation - new delegator- undelegation - outgoing delegator- stake - live stake change- update - poolcert change- block - new block- offrelay - relay is offline- onrelay - relay is back online- award - received new reward (like first 100 blocks) ### Compatibility Your callback script must return always pure text output simply "ok" (as we can remove old/notworking callback without this)
ok

```
